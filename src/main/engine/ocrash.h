/***************************************************************************
    Collision & Crash Code. 
    
    There are two types of collision: Scenery & Traffic.
    
    1/ Traffic: The Ferrari will spin after a collision.
    2/ Scenery: There are three types of scenery collision:
       - Low speed bump. Car rises slightly in the air and stalls.
       - Mid speed spin. Car spins and slides after collision.
       - High speed flip. If slightly slower, car rolls into screen.
         Otherwise, grows towards screen and vanishes
         
    Known Issues With Original Code:
    - Passenger sprites flicker if they land moving in the water on Stage 1
    
    The Ferrari sprite is used differently by the crash code.
    As there's only one of them, I've rolled the additional variables into
    this class.
